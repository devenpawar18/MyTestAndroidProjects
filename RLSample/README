This application is a sample implementation of the RedLaser SDK

To integrate into a new/existing project, copy the libs folder from this project as well as the overlay_logo.png resource.

It is recommended that you use the RedLaserSDK class as a starting point in your own app.

or you could follow the directions below:

Create a new Activity that extends BarcodeScanActivity located in:
com.ebay.redlasersdk.scanner.BarcodeScanActivity

on your class's onCreate() create a RedLaserSettings object and set the AppCode as well as the custom text placeholders.

You can configure the overlay to have up to 3 buttons by calling the setButtons() method.

For no buttons call "setButtons(null,null,null);"
For 3 different buttons call "setButtons("Finish","Manual Entry","Help");" passing in the labels you would like to appear on the buttons.

If you choose to have buttons on the overlay you need to override the following methods:

void onButton1Click()
void onButton2Click()
void onButton3Click()
